                        in the large
                        bowel of our body. Bowel cancer is a general term for a cancer that begins in a large bowel or
                        large intestine (bowel is an organ below the stomach also known as the colon or large
                        intestine). Bowel particles can grow and become large which can create a blockage in the
                        intestine. </p>

                    <p class="info">
                        One of the causes is age. Almost 9 in 10 cases of bowel cancer occur in people aged 60 or over.
                        Diet is also a leading cause of bowel cancer for the elderly. A diet high in red or processed
                        meats and low in fibre can increase your risk. More causes of bowel cancer include excess weight
                        and lack of exercise. </p>
                    <h4 class="sub-heading">Women:</h4>
                    <p class="info">The exact cause of colorectal cancer is not known, but certain risk factors are
                        strongly linked
                        to the disease, including diet, tobacco smoking and heavy alcohol use. Also, people with certain
                        hereditary cancer syndromes or a family history of colorectal cancer have a high risk of
                        developing the disease.</p>
                    <p class="info">Family history of colon cancer or polyps.
                        Having a parent, sibling, or other close relative with colon cancer or a history of polyps
                        makes you more likely to develop colon cancer.</p>

                        Fatigue other effects include bleeding rectum and cramps.</p>



                    <p class="info">The age standardized rates of colorectal cancer in India have been estimated to be
                        4.2 and
                        3.2/100,000 for males and females, respectively, compared to 35.3 and 25.7, respectively, in the
                        USA. Colorectal cancer is generally a disease affecting individuals 50 years of age or older.
                        90% of cases in India are people above the age of 60.

                        54.3% patients that are diagnosed with colon cancer, ages 60 above die from colon cancer . They
                        die in about 2 or 3 years after they are diagnosed of the disease.

                        45.7 % survive and are able to live for another 5 or 7 years . If they are healthy enough or get
                        luck they get up to 10 years.</p>

                    <h4 class="sub-heading">Women:</h4>
                    <p class="info">In its early stages, colon cancer may have no noticeable symptoms. When they do
                        occur, signs
                        of colon cancer in women tend to be the same as those seen in men, and can include:
                        constipation, diarrhea, or other changes in bowel habits. blood stool or rectal bleeding.</p>
                    <h4 class="sub-heading">Youngsters</h4>
                    <p class="info">More than 16,000 people younger than 50 are currently diagnosed with colorectal
                        cancer each year. There are 45 new cases each day and 3,600 -- 10 per day -- die from the
                        disease</p>
                    <p class="info">More young adults are being diagnosed with this type of cancer, and more are dying
                        from it.
                        While colorectal cancer death rates overall were cut in half between 1970 and 2016, the American
                        Cancer Society (ACS) says there has been a 51% increase in colorectal cancer among those under
                        age 50 since 1994. New cases of colorectal cancer in adults under 55 have increased almost 2%
                        every year since the mid-1990s, and death rates in this age group are also rising, even though
                        colonoscopies are more common.</p>

                    <p class="info">Men and women are equally at risk for bowel cancer, but men are more likely to
                        develop it</p>
                    <p class="sub-heading">Also people who eat a lot of cholesterol and very less fibre are more prone to it</p>

                    <h2 id="prevention">Prevention:</h2>
                    <p class="info">Now let’s talk about how to prevent bowel cancer as <strong><em>“Prevention is
                                better than
                                cure”</em></strong>.
                    <ol>
                        <li>First of all to have a healthy body you also need to have to eat healthy. Now be eat healthy
                            I specifically mean a <strong><em>‘High Fibre Diet’</em></strong>. This means no French
                            fries or
                            potato chips as these very low fibre foods which is not at all good for your digestive
                            system.</li>
                        <li>Now if you already have a good diet but you don’t really go out then you better change. It
                            is scientifically proven that <strong>physically active people have a lesser chance on
                                developing
                                bowel cancer</strong> as moving around helps digestion by a lot.</li>
                        <li>And last but not the least is to <strong>know your family history</strong>. This means that
                            you should
                            know if someone in your family previously had bowel cancer, smokes/used to smoke, or if
                            he/she was overweight as your genes also play a big role in the development of bowel cancer.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
